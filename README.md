👋 **Hey there! I'm Michael Macgregor!**  
🎯 Aspiring SOC Analyst | 🔒 Passionate about Self-Reliance & Disaster Mitigation  

I'm deeply committed to helping people develop systems for self-reliance and personal security. I love exploring tech and building Raspberry Pi projects, especially ones that integrate with Ham radio 📻. Currently, I'm building out my home lab to advance my career in cybersecurity, starting with a focus on SOC analysis.

🌍 **Living in Wyoming**  
🛠️ Most of my time is spent working on SOC analyst home lab projects to sharpen my cybersecurity skills. I dive into Python scripting 🐍, Kali Linux 🐱‍💻, and AWS cloud solutions ☁️.  

📺 **YouTube & Self-Reliance**  
On my YouTube channel, I share practical skills for self-reliance because I believe in being prepared for an unpredictable world. Adaptation and overcoming challenges are key to growth, and I aim to avoid stagnation—life is about continuous improvement!  

🎧 **Keeping Up with Cybersecurity**  
I stay informed by regularly tuning into the SimplyCyber podcast, which helps me stay updated on the latest in the cybersecurity field.

👨‍🏫 **Background in Teaching**  
Early in my tech journey, I was a college instructor teaching video production and web design. This experience introduced me to networking, where I set up systems for students to transfer large files to a RAID disk array accessible for project grading.
